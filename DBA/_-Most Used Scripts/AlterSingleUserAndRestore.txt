When the database is back to normal, you can first set it into single use mode before you restore it ot make sure other connections are out (forcefully). This is disruptive behavoir as you are tellign SQL Server to forcefully kill and rollback any transactions, be careful. Have your restore command ready, I like to alter the database, switch context to master and immediately restore as such:


ALTER DATABASE My_DB_Name SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE
GO

USE master
GO

RESTORE DATABASE My_DB_Name...
