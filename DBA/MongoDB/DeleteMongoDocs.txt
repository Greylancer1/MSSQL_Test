> mongo --host hostname --port portnumber dbname script.js 

or 

> mongo hostname:portnumber/dbname script.js 

will connect to the server at hostname:portnumber and execute the 
script stored in the file "script.js". 

When running the script it doesn't echo the results of each line to 
standard output the way the shell does when you run it in interactive 
mode, so you can debug the script in interactive mode first. 

As far as the remove statement itself goes, wouldn't it just be 
something like: 

> var cutoff = ISODate("2011-05-20") 
> db.test.remove({updated_at : {$lt : cutoff}}) 



You can give any Date with Javascript date

db.user_track.remove( { access_time : {"$lt" : new Date(year, month_0_indexed, day)} })

So for removing documents before 1 September 2013 your command should be

db.user_track.remove( { access_time : {"$lt" : new Date(2013, 8, 1) } })

September is the 9th month but the month field is zero indexed. So we make that as 8.
