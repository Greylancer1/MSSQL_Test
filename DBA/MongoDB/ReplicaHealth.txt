The following example runs the replSetGetStatus command on the admin database of the replica set primary:

db.adminCommand( { replSetGetStatus : 1 } )

Each member of a replica set has a state that reflects its disposition within the set.

Number	Name	State Description
0	STARTUP	Not yet an active member of any set. All members start up in this state. The mongod parses the replica set configuration document while in STARTUP.
1	PRIMARY	The member in state primary is the only member that can accept write operations. Eligible to vote.
2	SECONDARY	A member in state secondary is replicating the data store. Eligible to vote.
3	RECOVERING	Members either perform startup self-checks, or transition from completing a rollback or resync. Eligible to vote.
5	STARTUP2	The member has joined the set and is running an initial sync.
6	UNKNOWN	The member’s state, as seen from another member of the set, is not yet known.
7	ARBITER	Arbiters do not replicate data and exist solely to participate in elections.
8	DOWN	The member, as seen from another member of the set, is unreachable.
9	ROLLBACK	This member is actively performing a rollback. Data is not available for reads.
10	REMOVED	This member was once in a replica set but was subsequently removed.
