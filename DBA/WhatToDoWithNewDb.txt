I perform a complete analysis of the database by reviewing the database's objects (reverse engineer it with data modeling tools), file layout, initial database requirements, applications connecting to the database, documented problems and errors from the database and the server that have occurred over the past few months, review SQL Server error logs and Windows NT/2000 Event logs for the server, and run a trace against the database for a week to get a feel for what type of activity is being created. These are a few of the items I will perform before I can take responsibility and support of an existing user database.
