1.  First pull data from SXA into MSSQL2 SXAUser table.
TRUNCATE TABLE SXAUsers
SELECT DISTINCT dbo.CV3User.FirstName, dbo.CV3User.LastName, dbo.CV3User.IDCode, dbo.CV3OrganizationalUnit.Name, dbo.CV3User.OccupationCode
FROM         dbo.CV3OrganizationalUnit RIGHT OUTER JOIN
                      dbo.CV3User ON dbo.CV3OrganizationalUnit.GUID = dbo.CV3User.OrgUnitGUID
WHERE     (dbo.CV3User.Active = 'true') AND (dbo.CV3User.IDCode IS NOT NULL)

2.  Match on username between Kronos users and SXA users via SecurityAudit view (export to Excel as UsersActiveInSXAandKronos.xls).
SELECT     dbo.SecurityAudit.FirstName, dbo.SecurityAudit.LastName, dbo.SecurityAudit.Username, dbo.SecurityAudit.Dept AS KronosDept, dbo.SXAUsers.Name AS SXADept, dbo.SecurityAudit.jobname AS KronosJob, dbo.SXAUsers.OccupationCode AS SXAJob
FROM         dbo.SXAUsers INNER JOIN
                      dbo.SecurityAudit ON dbo.SXAUsers.IDCode = dbo.SecurityAudit.Username

3.  Find all SXA users not in Kronos (export to Excel as UsersActiveInSXAnotKronos.xls)
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM SXAUsers
WHERE IDCode NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Username FROM SecurityAudit) 



MISC.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SXAUsers
WHERE IDCode NOT IN (SELECT Username FROM SecurityAudit) AND IDCode is NOT null

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SXAUsers
WHERE IDCode IN (SELECT Username FROM SecurityAudit) OR IDCode is null

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SXAUSERS

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SXAUsers
WHERE IDCode is null

SELECT DISTINCT * FROM SXAUsers
WHERE IDCode NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Username FROM SecurityAudit)
