If the transaction log is growing and will not truncate with a T-Log backup then:

1. Run "DBCC OPENTRAN" against problem database on all nodes.
This might return an open LSN for an ongoing transaction (Oldest non-distributed LSN : (38:272:1))
Or
it might come back with nothing. I believe this would happen if we killed CDC or messed with the AlwaysOn prior to running this.

2. Run "select log_reuse_wait_desc, name from sys.databases where name = 'Problem db name'"
It will probably return "REPLICATION <your_cdc_database>"
We would prefer to have it say "NOTHING <your_cdc_database>"

3. Take a T-Log backup.

4. Next run "CHECKPOINT" on the problem database and then rerun step 2.
Hopefully now the database log will show as empty.
