When you are running from your desktop, the DTS package is running with your
SQL and domain rights. When it is scheduled, it is running with one of two
sets of rights:
1. If the job is owned by a sysadmin, DTS runs as the account that SQL
Server runs under.
2. If the job is not owned by a sysadmin, DTS runs as the SQL Agent proxy
account.
